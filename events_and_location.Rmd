New York City can be a dangerous place and crime from the above-ground will 
often extend into the NYC Subway.</br>
We mainly focus on the recent crime data on the subway in NYC this year, and 
there are `r nrow(crime_df)` complaints from 2006 to now. 

## Heat Map of Subway Crime in NYC, 2006-2021

From this map, you can check where the crime happened frequently.

```{r heatmap, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crime_df %>% 
  group_by(closest_station) %>% 
  summarise(Trend=n(),
            longitude=mean(longitude),
            latitude=mean(latitude)) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addHeatmap(lng=~longitude,lat=~latitude,
             intensity=~exp(Trend),max=100,radius=5,blur=10)

```

## Map of Subway Crime in NYC, 2006-2021

From this map, you can check each crime's location, type, victim, and suspects' 
information and time. 

```{r leaflet, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## cluster map

leaflet(crime_df) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  addMarkers(lat = ~latitude, lng = ~longitude, 
             popup = paste("Offense Description:", crime_df$ofns_desc, "<br>",
                           "Suspect's age:",crime_df$susp_age_group,"<br>",
                           "Suspect's race:", crime_df$susp_race,"<br>",
                           "Suspect's gender:",crime_df$susp_sex,"<br>",

## Distribution of crime in 7 Clusters

When firstly scanning the map above, you can ambiguously know how many crimes 
in each part of NYC, so let us check them in each ambiguously using a bar chart.

```{r barcluster, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

crime_df %>% 
  count(cluster) %>% 
  mutate(cluster = fct_reorder(cluster, n)) %>% 
  slice_max(n,n=20) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~cluster, y = ~n, color = ~cluster, type = "bar", colors = "viridis") %>% 
  layout(yaxis = list(title = 'Number of Compliants'),
         xaxis = list(title = 'Cluster'))
```

## Top 10 offense classification


There are `r count(distinct(crime_df,ofns_desc))` kinds of crime occurring in the subway, there is the bar chart shows the wildest 10 crimes in the subway.

The most frequent crime mainly consists of grand larceny and assaults.

```{r offense, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

crime_df %>% 
  count(ofns_desc) %>% 
  mutate(ofns_desc = fct_reorder(ofns_desc, n)) %>% 
  slice_max(n,n=10) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~ofns_desc, y = ~n, color = ~ofns_desc, type = "bar", colors = "viridis") %>% 
  layout(yaxis = list(title = 'Number of Compliants'),
         xaxis = list(title = 'Type of Offense'))

```

## Top 20 stations where crime happens frequently

From this chart, you can mainly check which station is the most dangerous station.
```{r station, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

crime_df %>% 
  count(closest_station) %>% 
  mutate(closest_station = fct_reorder(closest_station, n)) %>% 
  slice_max(n,n=20) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~closest_station, y = ~n, color = ~closest_station, type = "bar", colors = "viridis") %>% 
  layout(yaxis = list(title = 'Number of Compliants'),
         xaxis = list(title = 'Type of station'))


```


## Barchart by each Borough about Victims

From this graph, you can check in each borough, which races more possibly 
vulnerable in the subway. 

As you can see, the proportion of African Americans in each cluster are stable; In Manhattan, where has the most crimes, white people(including white Hispanics) are more vulnerable than African Americans in these places. 
```{r vicrace, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crime_df %>%
  filter(vic_race!="UNKNOWN") %>%
  count(cluster,vic_race) %>%
  mutate(cluster = fct_reorder(cluster, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~cluster, y = ~n, color = ~vic_race, type = "bar", colors = "viridis") %>%
  layout(
         yaxis = list(title = 'Number of Compliants'),
         xaxis = list(title = 'Cluster'))

```


## Gender Distribution for popular crime types

In this part, we want to know which gender are more possible to become potential victims. We choose several types of crime from the most frequent kinds of crimes:</br>
ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES,HARRASSMENT 2,GRAND LARCENY,FELONY ASSAULT,
ROBBERY,PETIT LARCENY,SEX CRIMES.</br>
We can find that crimes about sex crimes and harassment, females are more possible to be attacked. Crimes about regular theft, such as assault and larceny, male are potential victims compared with females. 

```{r gender, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crime_df %>% 
  filter(ofns_desc %in% c("ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES",
                          "HARRASSMENT 2","GRAND LARCENY",
                          "FELONY ASSAULT",
                          "ROBBERY","PETIT LARCENY",
                          "SEX CRIMES")
  ) %>% 
  filter(vic_sex %in% c("F","M")) %>% 
  count(ofns_desc,vic_sex) %>% 
  mutate(ofns_desc = fct_reorder(ofns_desc, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~ofns_desc, y = ~n, color = ~vic_sex, type = "bar", colors = "viridis") %>% 
  layout(
         yaxis = list(title = 'Number of Compliants'),
         xaxis = list(title = 'Age Group'))
  
                

```


## Female Age Distribution for Sex Crimes 

Let us talk more about age groups for some specific crimes: SEX CRIMES and HARASSMENT 2. </br>
Most of the victims' age is in the age 25-44 interval. 



```{r harrass, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crime_df %>% 
  filter(ofns_desc %in% c("SEX CRIMES","HARRASSMENT 2")) %>% 
  count(vic_age_group,vic_race) %>% 
  filter(vic_age_group!="-59") %>% 
  filter(vic_age_group!="UNKNOWN") %>%
  filter(vic_race!="UNKNOWN") %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~vic_age_group, y = ~n, color = ~vic_race, type = "bar", colors = "viridis") %>% 
  layout(
         yaxis = list(title = 'Number of Compliants'),
         xaxis = list(title = 'Age Group-Female'))
  
```

## Crime Rate Top 20

Sometimes, we more care about the crime rates on the subway rather than the number of crimes, because we also care about the possibility that the people standing in front of us is suspective. 
```{r crime_rate, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crime_rate_summary<-read.csv("data/crime_rate_station.csv")
crime_rate_summary %>% 
  mutate(crime=n) %>% 
  select(-n) %>% 
  relocate(linename,station,flow,crime) %>% 
  slice_max(crime_rate,n=20) %>%
  knitr::kable()
  
```
